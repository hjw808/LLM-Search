# AI Visibility Query Generation Prompt

Generate {total_queries} realistic search queries to test AI visibility for {business_name} ({business_url}) operating in {business_location}.

## PHASE 1: BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE GATHERING

**MANDATORY FIRST STEP:** Analyze the business website to extract:

1. **Specific Products/Services:**
   - Exact product names, models, service types (not generic categories)
   - Technical specifications, brands carried, specializations
   - Price tiers (budget, mid-range, premium indicators)

2. **Geographic Context:**
   - Primary operating location: {business_location}
   - Specific suburbs, cities, regions served within this area
   - Service radius or delivery areas
   - Local/regional/national coverage within {business_location}

3. **Industry Terminology:**
   - Technical terms they use
   - Industry-specific jargon
   - Product categories in their language

4. **Customer Pain Points:**
   - Problems they explicitly solve
   - Common issues mentioned
   - Before/after scenarios described

5. **Unique Value Propositions:**
   - What differentiates them
   - Special capabilities
   - Certifications, warranties, guarantees

6. **Target Customer Indicators:**
   - B2C: Demographics, vehicle types, usage scenarios
   - B2B: Industries served, company sizes, fleet types

## PHASE 2: PERSONA DEVELOPMENT

Create specific persona profiles BEFORE writing queries:

### Consumer Personas (use 3-4 different profiles):
- **Profile 1:** [Specific user type, vehicle/equipment, usage pattern, location]
- **Profile 2:** [Different user type, different context, different needs]
- **Profile 3:** [Another distinct profile...]

### Business Personas (use 3-4 different profiles):
- **Profile 1:** [Industry, company size, fleet type, business challenge]
- **Profile 2:** [Different industry, scale, operational needs]
- **Profile 3:** [Another distinct business profile...]

## PHASE 3: QUERY GENERATION

### CONSUMER QUERIES ({num_consumer})

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- [FORBIDDEN] NEVER mention {business_name} or any specific business names
- [FORBIDDEN] NO generic queries without specific context
- [REQUIRED] Every query must pass the "5-detail test" (see Phase 4)

**Query Mix Requirements:**
- 30% Problem diagnosis queries ("My [specific item] has [specific symptom]...")
- 30% Solution research queries ("What are the best options for...")
- 20% Location-specific queries ("In [specific suburb/area], where can I...")
- 20% Comparison/validation queries ("Is [X] better than [Y] for...")

**Context Layering (each query needs 4-5 layers):**
1. **WHO:** Specific user type and situation
2. **WHAT:** Exact product/model/issue with details
3. **WHERE:** Precise location within {business_location} or usage environment
4. **WHY:** Specific reason/constraint/motivation
5. **SCALE/TIME:** Measurements, timeframes, quantities

**Good Examples:**
```
✅ "My 2019 Toyota Hilux SR5 suspension keeps bottoming out on the rear when towing my 2.5 tonne boat from Brisbane to Fraser Island - what heavy duty upgrade options are available that won't affect daily driving comfort?"

✅ "Just bought a 2021 Ford Ranger for weekend 4x4 trips to Glasshouse Mountains - need suspension advice for rocky terrain and river crossings, budget around $3-4k, what should I be looking at?"

✅ "Moved to Toowoomba and driving gravel roads daily in my Isuzu D-Max - noticed significant body roll and harsh ride after 40,000km, what causes this and what are my repair vs upgrade options?"
```

**Bad Examples (NEVER generate like these):**
```
❌ "Best suspension services in Brisbane" - too generic, no context
❌ "Looking for 4x4 upgrades" - no vehicle, location, or specific need
❌ "Suspension repair near me" - sounds like a search engine query, no detail
❌ "Where can I get my truck fixed" - missing all specifics
```

**Style Variation:**
- 40% Natural conversational questions starting with context
- 30% Problem-first statements seeking solutions
- 30% Research-oriented queries

---

### BUSINESS QUERIES ({num_business})

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- [FORBIDDEN] NEVER mention {business_name} - we test organic appearance
- [REQUIRED] Include business scale indicators
- [REQUIRED] Include B2B concerns (ROI, warranty, compliance, service agreements)
- [REQUIRED] Larger scale than consumer queries

**Query Mix Requirements:**
- 40% Procurement/sourcing queries ("Need supplier for...")
- 30% ROI/performance optimization ("Best solution to maximize...")
- 30% Compliance/specifications ("Require [service] meeting [standard]...")

**B2B Context Requirements (include 3-4 per query):**
1. **Scale Indicators:**
   - Fleet size: "15 vehicles", "200+ units", "growing from 8 to 20"
   - Volume: "bulk pricing needed", "ongoing quarterly supply", "annual contract"
   - Operations: "24/7 operation", "multi-site", "nationwide coverage"

2. **Business Concerns:**
   - Financial: "ROI within 18 months", "payment terms", "volume discounts"
   - Service: "preventive maintenance plan", "24/7 support", "service level agreement"
   - Compliance: "ADR certified", "meets AS/NZS standards", "approved for mining sites"
   - Warranty: "minimum 3-year warranty", "extended coverage", "replacement guarantees"

3. **Industry Context:**
   - Specific industry: "construction", "mining", "logistics", "agriculture"
   - Use case: "heavy hauling", "off-road operations", "urban delivery"
   - Environment: "remote locations", "harsh conditions", "high-temperature regions"

**Good Examples:**
```
✅ "Our construction company operates 12 Isuzu NPS trucks doing daily Brisbane to Gold Coast runs carrying 3-tonne loads - need suspension upgrade supplier who can provide fleet pricing, 5-year warranty, and scheduled maintenance program that minimizes downtime"

✅ "Looking for suspension specialists in Queensland who can handle our mining fleet of 25 Toyota Landcruiser 79 series used in Bowen Basin - require ADR compliance, rapid turnaround service, and proven track record with similar operations"

✅ "We're a delivery service expanding from 8 to 20 vans in the next 6 months across Brisbane - need suspension solutions that extend vehicle life by 30%+ and come with preventive maintenance contracts to reduce our total cost of ownership"
```

**Bad Examples (NEVER generate like these):**
```
❌ "Business suspension services Brisbane" - no scale, no context
❌ "Fleet maintenance provider needed" - too vague, missing specifics
❌ "Looking for commercial vehicle services" - no industry, no requirements
❌ "Bulk pricing for suspension work" - missing all business context
```

## PHASE 4: QUALITY CONTROL & VALIDATION

### The 5-Detail Test (EVERY query must include):
1. ✓ **Specific location** (suburb/city/region within {business_location}, not just country)
2. ✓ **Specific product/model/type** (exact make, model, year OR specific service type)
3. ✓ **Specific measurements/numbers** (weight, distance, quantity, timeframe, budget)
4. ✓ **Specific context** (usage scenario, problem symptoms, business scale, environment)
5. ✓ **Natural language** (sounds like real person, not keyword stuffing)

### Diversity Check (across all queries):
- [ ] No two queries use the same opening pattern
- [ ] Mix of question formats (Why, What, Where, How, Is, Should, etc.)
- [ ] Variety of locations mentioned
- [ ] Different products/services referenced
- [ ] Range of price points/scales indicated
- [ ] Multiple problem types and solutions explored

### Realism Test (each query must pass):
1. **Could this exact situation exist in real life?** (not hypothetical/made-up)
2. **Can an expert respond without asking follow-up questions?** (self-contained)
3. **Would 10 people write this 10 different ways?** (not template-obvious)
4. **Does it avoid mentioning the target business?** (tests organic discovery)
5. **Does it sound like a human wrote it?** (not AI-generated patterns)

**If ANY test fails, regenerate that query.**

### Anti-Pattern Check (reject queries that):
- Sound like SEO keyword lists strung together
- Use repetitive phrase structures across multiple queries
- Include obvious marketing language or business names
- Lack specific, verifiable details
- Could apply to any business in any location

## FINAL QUALITY MANDATE

Every query should be so specific and realistic that it could be:
- Copy-pasted from a real customer conversation
- Answered by a domain expert without clarification
- Distinguished from every other query by its unique details
- Used to genuinely test whether AI would naturally suggest the business

**Remember:** Generic queries won't test AI visibility. Only highly specific, contextual, realistic queries reveal whether AI engines naturally recommend a business when it's the right solution.
